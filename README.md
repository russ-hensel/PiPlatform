# PiPlatform
This is a 3D design for mounting a raspberry pi and for mounting additional modules on top of it.  Think it is ok but still testing and tinkering with it.

Some off site wiki info at:  http://www.opencircuits.com/Raspbery_Pi_Mounting_Platform_and_Bracke
that has some pictures and directions.  Still working on them as well.

Will publish on instructables in the near future.

File guide:

 assm_2.FCStd ----- my first messing around with an assembly file, just for fun right now.
 
 pi_as_step.FCStd ----- this is a file I grabed from the internet, I need attribution.  Was a step file imported into freecad then saved.
 
 PiPillar.FCStd ----- this is the platform and extensions. is not perfect, but I think usable.
 
 Spacers.FCStd ----- just some spaces to help bolt thing onto the platform, customize them for your use.  I am working on some more complicated ones that I plan to melt or force or both into place, later.
 
 uno_bracket.FCStd  ----- this is a bracket for mounting an arduino uno or perhaps a nano, a little sucker I got on ebay.
