# PiPlatform
This is a 3D design for mounting a raspberry pi and for mounting additional modules on top of it.  Think it is ok but still testing and tinkering with it.

Some off site wiki info at:  http://www.opencircuits.com/Raspbery_Pi_Mounting_Platform_and_Bracket
that has some pictures and directions.  Still woking on them as well.

Will publish on instructables in the near future.


First and formost are the FreeCad source files

PiPillar.FCStd      is the various parts for mounting the Pi and mounting other modules on it.
uno_bracket.FCStd   is an add on mounting bracket for an Arduino Uno, one of the cheap ( ebay or Amazon ) but
                    working models.  It has no holes, so I am more or less grabbing it by the edges.
