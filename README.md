# PiPlatform
This is a 3D design for mounting a raspberry pi and for mounting additional modules on top of it.  Think it is ok but still testing and tinkering with it.

Some off site wiki info at:  http://www.opencircuits.com/Raspbery_Pi_Mounting_Platform_and_Bracke
that has some pictures and directions.  Still working on them as well.

Will publish on instructables in the near future.
